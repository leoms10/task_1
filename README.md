One use case for elderly care for the age group 65+ would be an automated medication reminder system. This system would remind Sunita Sharma when it is time to take her medication. The system could be designed as a mobile app or a voice-activated device. 

The app or device would be connected to Sunita's electronic health records to determine which medications she is taking and when she needs to take them. The app or device would then send reminders to Sunita through the mobile app or device when it is time to take her medication. The reminders could be customized to include the type of medication and dosage, as well as a list of potential side effects. 

The app or device would also track Sunita's medications to ensure that she is taking them as prescribed. The app or device would also be able to provide Sunita with information about her medications, such as side effects and interactions. 

The app or device would also be able to connect to Sunita's health care provider, allowing her to easily contact them if she has any questions or concerns about her medications. 

To demonstrate this idea, I could create a prototype using the Android Studio IDE. I could create a basic user interface for the mobile app and program it to
The prototype will consist of the following components: 

•	A user interface with a signup/login page and a main page with options to activate/deactivate the fall detection feature, as well as to add family members and medical personnel to the contact list. 

•	A database to store user information and contact information. 

•	An algorithm to detect sudden changes in acceleration and alert the user and the contacts in case of a fall. 

•	An alert system to send notifications to the user’s contacts in case of a fall. 

•	A graph to show the user’s history of falls and their corresponding dates. 

•	A help section with instructions on how to use the app. 

This prototype will be able to detect falls and alert family members and medical personnel in case of an emergency. This will help improve the quality of life of elderly people and ensure that they receive the help they need in case of an accident.
